/*You are tasked with developing a program that calculates and adjusts employee salaries based on various criteria. 
 * The program should
 *  handle the following:

Salary Increment: If an employee's salary is greater than or equal to 30,000, provide a 10% increment to their salary.

Bonus: If an employee's salary is equal to 20,000, provide a bonus of 2,000.

Salary Improvement Advice: If an employee's salary is less than 15,000, print a message asking them to improve their work 
in order to 
get a higher salary.

Additional Allowances: Provide the following additional allowances for each employee:

House Rent Allowance (HRA): 10% of the current salary.
Travel Allowance (TA): 5% of the current salary.
Dearness Allowance (DA): 8% of the current salary.
The program should use a 1D array to store the salaries of employees and perform these operations for each employee.*/
